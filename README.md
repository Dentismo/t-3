# T3 Project

## Name

Dentismo Client/Server component

## Description

This package is the Client-side of the Dentismo Client/Server component. It provides a simple, understandable graphical interface for dentists to respond to their appointments, and users to see information about provided Clinics and fill out appointment forms. To interact with other components, the Dentismo Client only directly talks to the Dentismo Server.

### Technology

- React and ReactDOM for creating custom frontend components and mounting them on the HTML DOM. Routing is handled using React Router and State Management is handled using React's native Hooks API

- React Big Calendar for displaying a Calendar view for viewing clinic's appointment schedules

- TypeScript for easier debugging and overall increased developer experience

- MaterialUI for creating and customizing material components, ease of styling and displaying icons

- Notistack for displaying Snackbars
